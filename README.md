#1. Description of our Proposal
Assess how an extreme event -a shooting- affects the discussion about the right to bear arms in U.S. We will perform a Sentiment Analysis in Twitter about the 2nd Amendment and assess if some significant changes occur in the aftermath of the Texas shooting.

Additionally, we will merge the Twitter database with a subset of guns stocks from Bloomberg to check for the financial market sensitivity to the shooting. The ideal would be to include gun sales, but unfortunately there is no available database containing that statistic (federally licensed gun dealers must declare their sales to the ATF but that information is not unified or completely digitalized). We just know that there are more than 300 million guns in the United States, and that each year the growth rate in sales is increasing.

Data:
Twitter database (https://apps.twitter.com)
o   Tweets with keywords related to 2nd amendment and Las Vegas shooting
o   Timespan: October 24th, 2017-November 8th, 2017 (one week before and after Las Vegas shooting).
o   Variables in twitterâ€™s accounts: location (state)

Bloomberg database (* these are some examples of guns stocks)
o   Sturm Ruger (RGR): https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/RGR:US 
o   American Outdoor Brands (AOBC): https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AOBC:US 
o   Olin (OLN) : https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/OLN:US
o   Standard and Poor's 500 - S&P 500 (SPX): https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SPX:IND
